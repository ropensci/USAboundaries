## USAboundaries: Historical and Contemporary Boundaries of the United States of America

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/USAboundaries)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=USAboundaries)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/USAboundaries.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/USAboundaries)
[![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/ropensci/USAboundaries?branch=master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ropensci/USAboundaries)
[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ropensci/USAboundaries/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/ropensci/USAboundaries?branch=master)

This R package includes contemporary state, county, and congressional district boundaries for the United States of America, as well as historical boundaries from 1629 to 2000 for states and counties from the Newberry Library's [Atlas of Historical County Boundaries](http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/).

### Installation

You can install this package from CRAN.

```
install.packages("USAboundaries")
```

Or you can install the development version from GitHub using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools). You may also wish to install the high resolution data package.

```
devtools::install_github("ropensci/USAboundaries")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/USAboundariesData")
```

### Use

This package provides a set of functions, one for each of the types of boundaries that are available. These functions have a consistent interface. 

Passing a date to `us_states()` or `us_counties()` returns the boundaries for that date. If no date argument is passed, then contemporary boundaries are returned. The functions `us_congressional()` and `us_zipcodes()` only offer contemporary boundaries.

For any function, pass a character vector of state names to the `states =` argument to return only those states or territories.

For certain functions, more or less detailed boundary information is available by passing an argument to the `resolution =` argument.

See the examples below to see how the interface works, and see the documentation for each function for more details.

```{r}
library(USAboundaries) 
library(sp) # for the plot.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame method

states_1840 <- us_states("1840-03-12")
plot(states_1840)
title("U.S. state boundaries on March 3, 1840")

states_contemporary <- us_states()
plot(states_contemporary)
title("Contemporary U.S. state boundaries")

counties_va_1787 <- us_counties("1787-09-17", states = "Virginia")
plot(counties_va_1787)
title("County boundaries in Virginia in 1787")

counties_va <- us_counties(states = "Virginia")
plot(counties_va)
title("Contemporary county boundaries in Virginia")

counties_va_highres <- us_counties(states = "Virginia", resolution = "high")
plot(counties_va_highres)
title("Higher resolution contemporary county boundaries in Virginia")

congress <- us_congressional(states = "California")
plot(congress)
title("Congressional district boundaries in California")
```

### Related packages

Each function returns a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` which is suitable for use with the [sp](http://cran.r-project.org/package=sp) or [leaflet](http://cran.r-project.org/package=leaflet) packages, and which can be fortified by the [broom](http://cran.r-project.org/package=broom) package for use with [ggplot2](http://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2). See the [geojsonio](http://cran.r-project.org/package=geojsonio) package for functions to convert these boundaries to GeoJSON.

If you need U.S. Census Bureau boundary files which are not provided by this package, consider using the [tigris](http://cran.r-project.org/package=tigris) package, which downloads those shapefiles.
