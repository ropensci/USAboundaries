\title{Get historical or contemporary boundaries of the United States}
\usage{
us_boundaries(
  map_date = NULL,
  type = c("state", "county", "congressional"),
  resolution = c("low", "high"),
  states = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{map_date}{The date of the boundaries as some object coercible to a date
with \code{as.Date()}. For state maps the date must be between 3 September
1783 and 31 December 2000; for county maps the date must be between 30
December 1636 and 31 December 2000. A \code{NULL} value will return
contemporary boundaries. This value is ignored for types of boundaries
other than states and counties.}

\item{type}{The type of the map, either \code{state}, \code{county}, or
\code{congressional}.}

\item{resolution}{The resolution of the map. High resolution data is
contained in the suggested package \code{USAboundariesData}. If that
package is not available, you will be prompted to install it.}

\item{states}{A character vector of state or territory names. Only boundaries
for these states/territories will be returned.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object.
}
\description{
This function is a general-purpose wrapper around the more specific functions
in this package. It is provided for convenience and backward-compatibility
with earlier versions of the package. In most cases you should use the more
specific functions for the type of boundary that you need.
